# 📊 Power BI Loan Performance & Borrower Analysis

## 🔍 Project Overview

This Power BI project provides an **in-depth analysis of loan
performance, borrower profiles, and repayment behavior**.\
It transforms raw lending data into **interactive dashboards and
insights**, helping financial institutions, analysts, or researchers to
understand **loan risk, borrower trends, and payment patterns**.
